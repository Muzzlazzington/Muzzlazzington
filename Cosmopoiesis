Abstract
Science fiction began dominating the literary canon during its “golden age” (Nicholls, 1981, p. 258) of the 1920’s. Mass publishing and further advancements in technology and space exploration of the 1950/60s post war period meant a vast audience was inspired to imagine a technologically advanced near future. Today, the technological futures explored in science fiction are presented as more and more possible. Individuals such as astronaut Buzz Aldrin (Aldrin, B., Abraham, K., 2016) and physicist Stephen Hawking (Haken, 2017) promote the colonisation of Mars as the next necessary step for humans in the advancement of our species.
A small group of self-confessed, sci-fi fanatic billionaires have chosen to champion this Martian quest. Working alongside NASA (NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017) to invest in infrastructure and technologies needed to support life on Mars, they use climate change as a call to action, asserting the urgency and necessity in colonisation of other planets to evacuate a doomed Earth. But the cost of colonising Mars is so extraordinary it begs the question; wouldn't it be easier to address the root causes of climate change rather than create a whole new civilisation? Is the Billionaire Space Race really a solution, or an obfuscation of capitalist extraction in space? What other realities can be imagined? This thesis assesses space exploration as an extension of capitalism and a fallacy in solving climate change. It explores the possibilities of other speculative fictional futures exemplified by Afro/Indigenous Futurism and champions film and media as a medium of cultural change. 
In building a case study, we look at Australia’s Pilbara region, a microcosm of colonial and indigenous histories exemplifying capitalism’s need for infinite growth on a finite world. We situate ourselves in the crucible that is Brockman 4 iron ore mine, where the Juukan Gorge was recently destroyed in the name of expansion. By transforming Brockman 4 into a film studio, we will facilitate the development of indigenous futurist films. 
Building on the existing media coverage afforded to the destruction of the Juukan Gorge, we challenge the existing supposition of a science fiction inspired future, presenting alternative fictional narratives to inspire future generations to manifest alternate versions of the future.  


 
Introduction
 (Figure 1 – Mars, artist interpretation)
“After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system”(Lansdorp, 2012), says Mars One’s website, a defunct, Dutch not-for-profit organisation aimed at permanent Martian colonisation. But second-best means nothing when it comes to interplanetary habitability. Average temperatures on Mars sit at minus 60 degrees celsius, with the poles reaching minus 125 degrees. Storms ravage the rocky, cratered surface, often covering the whole planet. The thin atmosphere contains 95% carbon dioxide (C02) meaning people cannot breathe the air (Wild, 2021). Carbon dioxide is the base necessity in terraforming the planet to human habitability (Gohd, 2018) and terraforming is universally acknowledged as the only way for humans to live indefinitely on the planet (Mehta, 2021). But Mars is so hostile that nuclear detonations have been suggested, albeit discarded, as terraforming methods (Walker, 2015). Research suggests, however, that even if we could melt enough of Mars’ glaciers, there would not be enough C02 to generate a dense enough atmosphere (Jakosky, 2018). 

Indeed, with a journey time of seven months, even getting to the planet is treacherous. Furthermore, the effects of space on the human body are well documented: without an atmosphere there is increased exposure to solar radiation creating higher risk of cancer (Cucinotta, Durante, 2006); lower gravity leads to lower bone density and a slower cardiovascular system (Conkin, 2001); not to mention the psychological issues caused by isolation (Conkin, 2001). Mars is worthy of research and exploration but as a new home for humanity it is a desolate planet. So why are we funding such an expedition when we could use those financial resources here on earth? It is because Mars represents another step in the colonial canon of expansion. 
Part I – Colonialism 
Colonisation has always been presented as a societal panacea. As early as 1584, political commentator Richard Hakluyt was fiercely supporting Queen Elizabeth’s colonisation of the Americas. He proposed it as a solution to overpopulation, economic prosperity, and to stop the spread of Spanish Catholicism (Haklyut, 1584). More recently, a Golgafrinchim-esque (Adams, 1978) ship containing England’s unwanted was sent to colonise Australia. Today we still face problems of overpopulation and overconsumption, only now corporations are our rulers, capitalism is our religion (Carabelli, Cedrini, 2018), and climate change threatens everyone. But climate change is a global issue, so for colonisation to solve it we must naturally expand beyond the earth. However, the colonisation fallacy logically follows that after colonising one planet, we would inevitably need to colonise another. This endless growth is the essence of capitalism - as environmental economist Giorgos Kallis succinctly puts it, “Growth is what capitalism needs, knows, and does” (Kallis, 2015). In a poignant summation of the situation Professor Tim Jackson narrates that, “almost on cue, along comes a group of self-confessed technology lovers finally admitting that the planet is too small for us. Yes, you were right, they imply: the Earth cannot sustain infinite growth. That’s why we must expand into space” (Jackson, 2021). Colonising Mars is an extension of capitalist extraction into space, not a solution to climate change.
But how has capitalism been allowed to get into space? In his book, Post Growth—Life After Capitalism, Professor Tim Jackson argues that we have allowed Capitalism, “to trump everything: work, life, hope – even good governance” (Jackson, 2021). He cites a 1958 paper published by an executive of Shell Oil company. It reviewed air pollution caused by petroleum extraction (Jones, 1958). This is evidence fossil fuel companies knew about their impact on the environment three decades before James Hansen’s scientific testimony to Congress in 1988, which brought global warming to public attention (Holthaus, 2018). The reason nothing was done is because it would threaten profits of the most powerful corporations on the planet, and profit is the bedrock of capitalism (Jackson, 2021). In fact, profit is why space is such an attractive place. 
Interplanetary extraction has been building since 1967. During the Cold War’s Space Race, the UNOOOSA (United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs) created the Outer Space Treaty. It prevented any “celestial body” being subject to “national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means” (UN, 2222 (XXI)). Space law jurist, Stephan Hobe explains that the Outer Space Treaty, "explicitly and implicitly prohibits only the acquisition of territorial property rights" (Hobe, 2007). So, while international space law prohibits property rights over territories and outer space land, it is generally understood that extracting space resources is allowed, including by private companies for profit. Hobe further explains that there is no mention of, “the question of the extraction of natural resources which means that such use is allowed under the Outer Space Treaty” (Hobe, 2007, pp. 211). He also points out that there is an unsettled question regarding the division of benefits from outer space resources (Hobe, 2007). The result is unique for private companies looking to space for mineral collection as there is no territorial governance structure. There is no question of pre-existing ownership, so there is currently no body or government to grant leases or titles. Mineral extraction operates on a first come first served basis. In answer to the question of what is there to be mined, sitting between Mars and Jupiter is an asteroid belt comprised of millions of rare minerals. NASA’s Psyche Program involves visiting an asteroid lying between Mars and Jupiter which is made entirely of Iron and nickel (NASA, 2020). This asteroid has been valued at USD$10 quintillion (see figure 2). The whole asteroid mining industry has been valued at USD$700 quintillion (Smith, 2019) - that’s $100 billion for every one of the seven billion people on earth. This demonstrates an extraordinary incentive for those capable of extracting the wealth offered by space mining. 
 (Figure 2 – The most valuable asteroids in the universe)
In 2015 the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (commonly referred to as the Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship (SPACE) Act) was passed. It purported to grant US citizens freedom to engage in the exploration and exploitation of space. This was the catalyst for what has been coined the Billionaire Space Race (Lafranco, 2015) where the world’s wealthiest are competing to privatise space. The most prominent figures are Jeff Bezos, CEO of Blue Origin aerospace manufacturing; Sir Richard Branson, CEO of Virgin; and Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX. The lure of profit has attracted these powerful men to space. But how have they convinced the populace capitalist extraction in space is a solution to climate change? It is because of the control science fiction exerts over the cultural canon. 
Part II – Science Fiction
The idea of increasing capital extraction as a solution to over extraction and consumption is a paradox criticised repeatedly by contemporary economists: “the faster we produce and consume goods, the more we damage the environment” (Kallis, 2015). Despite this, the debate continues to rage on the limits of growth (Cassidy, 2020). Professor Tim Jackson interjects the conversation, delineating that the debate largely, “hangs on the power you attribute to technology to save us” (Jackson, 2021). 
Demonstrating this faith in technology is a 2017 article, Is Mars habitable? With the right technologies, yes, by aerospace engineer Max Fagin. He discusses technologies necessary for permanent human habitability on Mars (Fagin, 2017). He surmises that we have some technologies currently, but others are still being imagined and developed (Fagin, 2017). The insistence is on the inevitability of discovering the solutions, as colonising Mars is expected to take a long time. Elon Musk didactically explains, "you need to live in a dome initially but over time you could terraform Mars to look like Earth and eventually walk around outside without anything on. ... So it's a fixer-upper of a planet" (Steers, 2012). 
Architects such as Bjarke Ingels have begun designing what these habitats could look like (Figure 3). However, current investigations into living on Mars are only at the point of 3D printing prototype shells from local Martian material (Sawantt, 2021) and the cost of research is speculated to be in the tens of billions of dollars (Rothsching, 2019). Here is the crux of the confusion: this funding could be spent solving crisis that directly contribute to climate change, nullifying the need to leave earth. But the imagination of domes and Martian habitability represents an unerring faith in technology as salvation. This faith reflects a theory of evolution known as Technological Determinism, which suggests that a society’s technology dictates its social structure, culture, and history. It purports technological innovation as the driving force behind societal advancement (Dafoe, 2015). Technological determinism is the quintessence of science fiction. 
 (Figure 3 – Mars Science City render)
Jeffrey Bezos’ and Elon Musk are both self-confessed science fiction fanatics, whose obsession started with the science fiction of Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein (Curtley, 2019). In fact, both credit their interest in space with boyhood fantasies stemming from science fiction, with Musk tweeting in 2018, “[Asimov’s] Foundation Series & Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX” (Musk, 2018). It was reported at a conference on Mars colonisation that, “Musk also countered the suggestion that Mars might be “some escape hatch for rich people” by highlighting the risks of the mission: “It will be like Shackleton’s ad for Antarctic explorers: ‘Difficult, dangerous, a good chance you’ll die, excitement for those who survive.’ That kind of thing” (Solon, 2018). This interaction is profound. Firstly, despite being framed as a dismissal, it shows a bedrock acceptance that Mars is indeed only for the rich (yet willing). Secondly, Mars as salvation is so deeply ingrained in the cultural canon that the question the media ask isn’t ‘can we go’, it is ‘who can go’. Finally, and most interestingly, it points to the type of narratives influencing these individuals: adventure and heroism.
Feminist author, Ursula K. Le Guin analyses science fiction as dominated by heroism and adventure in her article, The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction. In it she relates Elizabeth Fisher’s Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution to the development of narrative within culture (Le Guin, 1986). The Carrier Bag Theory postulates that the first tool was not a weapon, or as Le Guin calls it, the “big, long, hard thing” (Le Guin, 1986), but was instead a basket or receptacle to gather, collect, and store (Fisher, 1979). She delineates the narrative of the basket as the ‘Life’ Story, with all the intricacies and difficulties, however mundane or metaphorical. In contrast the ‘Death’ Story (the dominant cultural canon) is infinitely more exciting, filled with danger and conflict and tragedy (Le Guin, 1986). Le Guin exclaims, “if science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. “Technology,” or “modern science” (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the “hard” sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now)” (Le Guin, 1986). The Life Story is about all living things and their complex interesting interactions. On the other hand, the Death Story is of one person’s heroic conquest. 
The Death Story is best conceptualised through a cultural discourse as the Hero’s Journey. Initially conceived from collating narrative trends in mythology by anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor (Segal, Raglan, Rank, 1990), it came into popular use through professor of literature, Joseph Campbell’s book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. As seen in Figure 4 below, the narrative is described thus: “A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered, and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man” (Campbell, 1949). Science fiction’s narratives of conquest, exploration and heroics are emblematic of the Hero’s Journey. But how has the Hero’s Journey, told through science fiction, become to dominate the cultural canon?
 
(Figure 4 – The Hero’s Journey)
Part III – White Saviours
Political journalist Jordan Flaherty explains the impact of the Hero’s Journey on society through the lens of the “White-Saviour Industrial Complex” (Flaherty, 2016). Coined by Nigerian American author Teju Cole in 2012, the term satirises US President Dwight Eisenhower’s warning of the “Military-Industrial Complex”. (Eisenhower, 1961). Eisenhower warned of the growing relation between the military and the industry that supplied it. Cole adopted the term to condemn the self-serving aid given to minority groups by white people. He uses Kony 2012 as a striking example where Americans rallied against an African warlord, despite concurrent military engagement in Afghanistan (Cole, 2012). Cole (2012) believes it is about, “a big emotional experience that validates privilege” (Cole, 2012), where heroism enables a picking and choosing of right and wrong. In this way, the hero story has morphed into what Flaherty (2016) calls the “saviour”. In his book No More Heroes: Grassroots Challenges to the Saviour Mentality, Flaherty explains, “the prototypical saviour is a person who has been raised in privilege and taught implicitly or explicitly (or both) that they possess the answers and skills needed to rescue others, no matter the situation… The saviour mentality means that you want to help others but are not open to guidance from those you want to help. Saviours fundamentally believe they are better than the people they are rescuing. Saviours want to support the struggle of communities that are not their own, but they believe they must remain in charge. The saviour always wants to lead, never to follow. When the people they have chosen to rescue tell them they are not helping, they think those people are mistaken. It is almost taken as evidence that they need more help” (Flaherty, 2016, pp. 17–18). Privilege becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, validating the individual identity as saviour, through the canon of Hero. The Hero’s Journey becomes about saviourism. In the narrative of climate change, humanity needs saving. Typified by Jeff Bezos’ speech, “we will have to leave this planet, and we’re going to leave it, and it’s going to make this planet better” (Boyle, 2018), the billionaires, with increased access to technology, consider themselves the heroes, and therefore saviours. 
The reason Bezos and the other Billionaires believe themselves heroes is concisely summarised by professor of history at Harvard, Jill Lepore. In her recent November 4th article she writes, “billionaires, having read stories of world-building as boys, are now rich enough, as men, to build worlds. The rest of us are trapped in them” (Lepore, 2021). She includes the fantastical, “magnificently inflated” (Lepore, 2021), mission statements of the tech companies inhabiting Silicon Valley as examples of, what she coins, “Muskism.” Leopre (2021) states, “Muskism is a capitalism in which companies worry — very publicly, and quite feverishly — about all manner of world-ending disasters, about the all-too-real catastrophe of climate change, but more often about mysterious “existential risks,” or x-risks, including the extinction of humanity, from which only techno-billionaires, apparently, can save us.” 
The success of Muskism within the cultural canon is an example of a branch of psychology called “terror management theory” (Greenberg, 1986). Greenberg (1986) tells us that, when mortality becomes salient, instead of addressing the underlying fear, we turn for comfort to the things which make us feel good. Fighting climate change is overwhelmingly terrifying; so, we have consequently chosen the magic of Muskism. But as a point of irony, Muskism can be elucidated as a failed cultural canon through famous science fiction writer, Arthur C. Clarke’s Three Laws. The third of which, proclaims: “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic” (Clarke, 1962). Muskism technology is so advanced it does not yet exist. It is inherently magic. Therefore, the general populace is being sold science fiction, masking increased capitalist extraction, as a solution to climate change. But science fiction’s canon has failed to imagine a different reality where we don’t have to leave earth at all. 
Part IV – Indigenous Futurism
  
(Figure 5 - Things Are Looking Native, Native’s Looking Whiter)
The impact of the Hero’s Journey has been so strong on contemporary culture that Le Guin laments alternate narratives are difficult to imagine. “It sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all… The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story” (Le Guin, 1986).  But if Science Fiction is the Death/Hero story, its inverse must be the Life Story. 
Science fiction frames the future through a western colonial paradigm. It conceives human identity as superior to, and therefore outside of nature. In contrast, the indigenous person, harmonious with nature, is therefore always considered primitive. For Satre, this fixation of the primitive onto the indigenous person constitutes a form of enslavement (Sartre, 1943). An enslavement which, according to Fanon, reproduces settler/colonial forms of rule (Fanon, 1986). Bell Hooks argues that colonial obsession for the primitive is so powerful that it fixes the indigenous person temporally (Hooks, 1992). Science fiction negates indigenous futurity as the indigenous person is held captive in time. Musician and cultural critic, Greg Tate, reflects on the history of African Americans in the United States. He comments “black people live the alienation that science fiction writers imagined” (Inverse, 2018). 
Inverse media’s video Afrofuturism Explained: Not Just Black SciFi, observes how a “500-year history of colonialism, slavery, racism, and segregation have left people of the African diaspora with a disjointed idea of what it really means to be home” (Inverse, 2018). Afrofuturism, a term coined by cultural critic Mark Dery in 1993, is a practice and methodology for African Americans to evaluate their past; perceive themselves in the future; and improve their present. As Vox media pronounces, “Afrofuturism shows us what that [future] looks like, it looks like hope” (Barton, Massie, Posner, 2016). This sentiment reflects the words of Welsh writer, Raymond Williams: “to be truly radical is to make hope possible, rather than despair convincing” (Williams, p.118). Afrofuturist narratives present themselves as alternatives to science fiction for imagining an alternate future.
But Afrofuturism is not an insertion of African identity into science fiction. Afrofuturist author, Octavia Butler called out science fiction as the white man’s futurism in her 1980 essay, The Lost Races of Science Fiction. Butler identifies science fiction’s prevalence toward ignoring minorities stories and the necessity to, “justify their blackness” (Butler, 1980), when including minority characters. She reflects on this as reinforcing the cultural narrative of white maleness as the norm, and all other genders and ethnicities as the other (Butler, 1980). 
In a 2014 interview regarding increasing ethnic diversity in science fiction, author Nalo Hopkinson furthered the criticism of science fiction’s exclusivity. He says, “the standard excuse in science fiction is that in the future, there won't be any racism or classism, or we won't have any races because we'll all interbreed… those are really excuses for lazy characterization that erases ethnocultural specificities and differences in experience” (Abad-Santos, 2014). These differences are the core of Le Guin’s (1986) Life Story. Homogenising culture avoids having to deal with non-eurocentric/male problems so a prevailing single “Death” (Le Guin, 1986) narrative of a Hero can continue. When science fiction does include other narratives, they are represented as alien. Figure 5 exemplifies this appropriation of indigeneity. Galanin’s piece juxtaposes Princess Leia of Star Wars with a woman of the artist’s own Tlingit and Unangax̂ culture. It confronts the colonial exploitation of indigenous culture in science fiction. 
According to English professor, Rob Latham, science fiction’s homogenisation is because, “to the writers of the 1930s and 1940s, conquering a new world was a doctrine of manifest destiny. Conquering a new world means something different to people who were brought to the country in chains or were displaced or subject to genocide” (Abad-Santos, 2014). Afrofuturism is a way of grappling with past trauma as well as being a method of seeing oneself in the future. Professor of Afrofuturism/Artist, D. Denenge Duyst-Apkem, says that, for African Americans, “Afrofuturism is a pathway to black liberation. It provides an avenue to be able to transform ourselves and our communities” (Inverse, 2018). To imagine oneself in the future, representation in media is key. 
 
(Figure 6 – Sun Ra in Space is the Place)
African American artists such as jazz musician Sun Ra (Le Sony'r Ra, (born Herman Poole Blount)), and Funk musician George Clinton are often referenced as key figures of Afrofuturism. In his 1973 album and later film, Space is the Place (Figure 6), Sun Ra presents an Afrocentric future – linking his futuristic self, to ancient forbears in Egypt. 
George Clinton was more politically direct. In Mothership Connection, George Clinton connects the struggle of civil rights to a positive future with evidence the struggle will work. Referencing American folk singer and political activist, Pete Seeger’s We Shall Overcome, Clinton sings, “You have overcome. For I am here” (Clinton, 1975). Further, Clinton references the Christian hymn, and African American spiritual song Swing Low Sweet Chariot, flipping the eponymous line into a positive, futuristic ride on his spaceship as evidence the struggle is over, and they’ve won, “Swing down, sweet chariot. Stop and let me ride” (Clinton, 1975). 
Since then, other prominent leaders of black culture in America have referenced it: Dr Dre’s, Let me Ride (Dr Dre, 1993). Afrofuturism is a way of grappling with past trauma as well as being a method of seeing oneself in the future. Hip-hop artist, Andre 3000’s verse in ATLiens critiques the current outlook of the future, “… because the future world depends on if or if not the child, we raise gon’ have that n***a syndrome. Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone” (Outkast, 1996). He wants children to have the future they want, not the one society prescribed them because of race. Then he celebrates blackness and difference, “they alienate us cause we different keep your hands to the sky. Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain’t no lie” (Outkast, 1996). Finally, he empowers black people to manifest their own future, “I’ll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie” (Outkast, 1996). Afrofuturism is about black people manifesting a better future for themselves on their terms. In her talk, Afrofuturism Imagination and Humanity, Ytasha Womacks points out the importance of Afrofuturism as, “using the imagination to transcend circumstances… imaging oneself in the future creates agency” (Sonic Acts, 2017, 6:37). Afrofuturism is to African Americans what the science fiction canon is to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
 
(Figure 7 - The Path Without End)
Afro-futurism has been adapted throughout the wider diaspora of indigenous peoples under, what Anishinaabe scholar Grace L. Dillon coined, “Indigenous Futurism” (Dillon, 2012). While Indigenous Futurism is a new concept, indigenous director Elizabeth Lameman argues that Indigenous Futurism is not new but forgotten (Lameman, 2012). Her film The Path Without End, is an Anishinaabe steampunk film that tells the timeless story of Moon People who canoe the stars avoiding the insatiable spirit of Wetiko [chaos]. She animates natural and organic materials, such as, “copper, rawhide, leather, bone, beads, rocks, shells, birch bark” (Lameman, 2012), to deliberately convey indigenous understanding of nature as technology, and humans as nature. Lameman (2012) proclaims, “we do and did have technology, but since we use(d) biodegradable materials, and thus “evidence” has faded with nature, we are told by the dominate culture that we were savage with no technology”. Indigenous Futurism is a tool to deconstruct colonisation’s impact and recover ancestral traditions, adapting them to a future world. 
In her book Walking the Clouds: An Anthology of Indigenous Science Fiction, Dillon collects indigenous speculative fiction stories. It opens with the statement: “all forms of indigenous futurisms are narratives of biskaabiiyang, an Anishinaabemowin word connoting the process of ‘returning to ourselves,’ which involves discovering how personally one is affected by colonization, discarding the emotional and psychological baggage carried from its impact, and recovering ancestral traditions in order to adapt in our post-Native Apocalypse world” (Whitepigeon, 2020). Indigenous Futurism is about the multiplicity of narrative, affording each indigenous peoples their own futurism. These multiplicities constitute Le Guin’s (1986) Life Story. 
 
(Figure 8 – The Thunder Up Above) 
Case Study
In the wake of Covid, continued connection with culture in representations of the future are crucial for continuing indigenous traditions. On 20 September, Māori Professor Elizabeth McKinley ONZM gave a talk about indigenous-led social change. She laments the impact of Covid 19 on indigenous communities: “the finality of it all. I think there have been many tribes across the world that in are in dire straits around maintaining their knowledge and their language” (Melbourne Uni, 2021). For indigenous, the impact of Covid is more than the death of people, it threatens the death of cultures. What if there were a facility that promoted the telling and spread of indigenous futurist films and stories? Publishing these narratives to impact the wider world with a hopeful, inclusive future, rather than the one we have been prescribed by science fiction.
Australia’s history is one of western colonisation, exemplified by its history of mining. Prior to the 1978 Mining Act, mining operations had no environmental rehabilitation at all, leaving behind a legacy of holes pockmarking the country. Despite this, the current program still places rehabilitation post extraction, highlighting the perceived importance of mining over the Earth itself. This detachment from land reflects the paradigm of western colonialism, where human identity is superior to nature, and consequently, the indigenous. Summarized best by journalist John Pilger: “As children, we were given to understand that we were merely innocent bystanders to the slow and natural death of an ancient people, the First Australians, rather than the inheritors of a history every bit as rapacious as that of the United States, Latin America, Africa” (Pilger, 1985). The narrative of Australia excludes the First Nations Peoples as actors, and without representation they are automatically precluded from envisaging their own futures. 



The Site
Located 200km South of Dampier, WA, is iron ore mine Brockman 4, a microcosm for this conflict. In March 2020, Rio Tinto destroyed an Australian First Nation’s site of "the highest archaeological significance in Australia" (Jenkins, 2020) according to archaeologist Michael Slack. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) People have lost a part of their (and Australia’s) history forever. An internal investigation by Rio Tinto found that no one person was at fault. Instead, Rio Tinto’s bureaucratic hierarchy negated responsibility by spreading it across the whole corporation (Thomson, 2020). 
Building on the press coverage as a catalyst, we follow a speculative fictional narrative where the outcome of the Juukan Gorge investigation into Rio Tinto produced an outcome. A lawsuit is filed, laws are changed, and the Juukan Gorge is returned to The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people. 
The Reimagining
A film studio is created adjacent to the destroyed Juukan Gorge, within Brockman 4’s Western Pit. Funded by Rio Tinto, the film studio is comprised of huge pieces of scaffolding that can be lifted and shifted to create all varieties of sets. Mining machines are adapted to carry, lift, and construct the scaffolding upon which people climb across the site, building their own new narratives. Stories, messages, and histories are carved into the shaft walls. A green screen flows along tracks suspended a hundred meters into the air, cascading down to cover multiple sets at once. Through a film studio, inspired by Indigenous Futurism, we will create a multiplicity of narratives for the future of Australia. Through representation in film, we will generate cultural change by encouraging all of Australia (and thanks to the internet, humanity) to imagine multiple visions for the future.
 
Conclusion
The colonisation of Mars is the first steppingstone to interplanetary mining. Billionaires, keen on this lucrative industry, are funding Martian technologies under the guise of climate solutions. The flawed concept of more extraction to solve climate change is given credence by technological determinism. 
Technological Determinism is supported by science fictions domination of the cultural canon through the Hero’s Journey. However, science fiction is a colonial narrative, representing the white man as Hero. If science fiction presents us with the future of evacuation/ “Death” (Le Guin, 1986), Indigenous Futurism and Afrofuturism present us with the story of “Life” (Le Guin, 1986). To imagine a future where we don’t have to evacuate earth, we draw on the voices neglected by science fiction’s canon. We use speculative fiction to create a case study highlighting the Australian mining industry as a colonial process. Through examination we propose a film centre intervention within Brockman 4 iron ore mine. Indigenous futurist inspired film production will facilitate increased representation in media of other. Through representation, we aim to change the cultural canon so a wider variety of individuals can manifest diverse futures.
